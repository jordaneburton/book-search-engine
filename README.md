# Book-Search-Engine
An app using the Google Books API search engine built with a GraphQL API and an Apollo Server

## Description

The Book-Search-Engine is a refactoring of another project. The original code utilizes a RESTful API to allow users to create an account and search for books, as well as save books that you may like. This project is refactored to use a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.
